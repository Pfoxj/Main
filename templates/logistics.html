    The Internet Archive is located at 300 Funston Avenue in the Richmond District of San Francisco, four miles west of downtown. Our neighborhood, bordered by the Presidio to the north and Golden Gate Park to the south,  is a melting pot of cultures with a plethora of eateries, shops, and bookstores. The building itself, formerly a Christian Science church, now houses petabytes of data — including images, texts, music, software and more.
