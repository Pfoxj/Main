  <div class="schedule-intro">
    On June 9th, the day after the Decentralized Web Summit, we will be hosting a Decentralized Web meetup at the Internet Archive. This meetup is free and open to the public. We will have tables set up for people to meet and hack on decentralized web projects, and have lightning talks scheduled in the Great Room upstairs throughout the day. If you are interested in learning more about the decentralized web or working on related projects with your peers, this is the place to be! Snacks and drinks will be provided.
