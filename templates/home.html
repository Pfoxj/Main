        <p>The current Web is not private or censorship-free. It lacks a memory, a way to preserve our culture’s digital record through time. The Decentralized Web aims to make the Web open, secure and free of censorship by distributing data, processing, and hosting across millions of computers around the world, with no centralized control.</p>

        <div class="subheader">Sharing vision &amp; Tech know-how</div>
        <p>The Summit is a one-day event for high level discussions among leaders from around the globe working on decentralized technologies. What decentralized applications are being built today, and what is just around the corner? Together, can we prototype the Decentralized Web and start to lock the Web open for good?</p>
