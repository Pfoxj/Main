# Decentralized Web Summit website

This is a "static" site, meaning there is no backend (eg python, php, node). 

While this might sacrifice some convenience, it means that this website can be made decentralized and served through p2p channels.

At the moment this site is hosted on NeoCities and also available through IPFS.
