The short version: The Decentralized Web Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free social experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion or political affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of event organizers.

The long version: Harassment includes offensive verbal comments and imagery related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors, speakers and sponsors are also subject to the Code of Conduct.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please take steps to mitigate the issue or contact an event organizer to do so. ALL ACTIONS TAKEN SHOULD BE NON-VIOLENT. If you respond to harassment with non-defensive violence, you will be sanctioned or expelled.

Event organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any Decentralized Web Summit events. We value your attendance.
