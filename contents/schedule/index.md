    title: "Keynote Address: Vint Cerf – \"A Web that Archives Itself\""
    description: The Internet Archive has started the process of preserving the WWW but there is an opportunity to refine the design of WWW to create a self-archiving, distributed system. I hope to explore some of the desirable properties of such a self-archiving system from the technical perspective but feel compelled to consider business models that make the process sustainable and affordable. This is clearly more than just a technical problem.

      In the last twenty years, we've managed to nearly ruin one of the most functional distributed systems ever created: today's Web. There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code. We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values. Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.

          Bringing gender equality and ethnic diversity to the decentralized technology community is an important method to fully realise the scope of the revolutionary ideas we're exploring. During the curation of the conference preparation we were already aware of the lack of gender and cultural diversity in the history of the Internet and technology as a whole. We took significant steps to facilitate viewpoints of underrepresented perspectives but it does not end with this conference. We have 25% female speakers during the Decentralised Web Summit but we strongly feel that we need to address this with more passion. In this workshop we like to claim the space for gender equality and ethnic diversity in building the future decentralised and open Internet. Our proposal is to start a working group on this topic during the conference but since we understand that this is the first event of a series of events we hope to establish a plan moving forward as well. There were similar discussions during Ouishare Fest in May with the consensus to create a task force that works on this. We would love to initiate an collaborative effort from actors across networks and communities, including get-d.net, blockchainworkshops.org, ouishare.net etc.

In addition we provide a commodities market that tracks the price of goods in services traded on the network as financial decision making data for negotiating the price of goods and services. This lays the foundation for a sustainable universal basic income that not only encourages contribution to society but the funding of innovation either indirectly through currency or by direct human effort or contribution. The current non-linear, inflationary economies of the world cannot support this concept. This system monetizes charity as opposed to scarcity of resources.  It also meets  the criteria of being an Open Value Network. I'd love to share more information in person. The paper detailing the full system or our github wiki can be reached through our website.

          Building decentralized software is hard. Development frameworks are built thinking in centralized apps, moreover when thinking of collaborative apps. SwellRT is a development framework for building decentralized real-time collaborative apps, very easily and avoiding extra code to the developer. SwellRT provides a server side (storage, sharing, identity, federation) and an API to build apps in JavaScript, Java or Android. Think of Google Drive RT API or Firebase but decentralized & open source.

          IPLD is the internal data format for IPFS, Mediachain, uPort, IPDB, and other systems. A large variety of protocols use merkle-linked datastructures (git, bittorrent, ipfs, tahoe-lafs, sfs, etc). IPLD is an interchangeable data format to unify these types of systems. It can represent any merkle-tree or hash-chain data, perfect for peer-to-peer protocols and decentralizing the web.

          Our goal at the Summit is to increase the collaboration between all our p2p protocols. IPLD is a fantastic vector for collaboration!

          This workshop will cover:

          - IPLD Motivation and Intoduction
          - IPLD Design
            - merkle-links: the core unit of a merkle-graph
            - merkle-paths: unix-style paths for traversing merkle-graphs with named merkle-links
            - IPLD Data Model: a flexible, JSON-based data model for representing merkle-dags.
            - IPLD Serializion: a set of formats in which IPLD objects can be represented, for example JSON, CBOR, CSON, YAML, Protobuf, XML, RDF, etc.
          - Concrete IPLD Examples:
            - Filesystems
            - Version Control Systems
            - Blockchains
            - Indexing
            - Mapping
          - How is IPLD used in IPFS and other systems

          Interledger is a protocol suite for connecting blockchains, payment networks and other digital asset ledgers. It enables transfers between parties on different ledgers, meaning it can be used to build payments or micropayments into other protocols and apps without being tied to a single payment provider or currency. We will be showing off demos of Interledger in action, walking through how to build it into your projects and how to Interledger-enable your ledger, and discussing how it works under the hood.

          Interledger is heavily inspired by the designs of IP, TCP, etc so also come talk to us if you are interested in aspects of the Internet's design to emulate or avoid.

          A brief intro to Nodesphere, an interchange and interoperability toolkit for creating and sharing semantic graphs from a variety of data sources.  Both a protocol and open source codebase in active development, it has three primary objectives:

          1. Create interoperability among graph visualization interfaces.

          2. Provide adaptors to connect these interfaces to personal data ecosystems, including browsing history, social network data, cloud storage, and ultimately, any public or private data.

          3. Abstract data sources into semantically linked unified dashboards, facilitating the transition from traditional server & database systems toward secure, distributed public and private storage, as these systems become practical and performant.

          Platform Cooperatives and the Decentralized Web

          As we resist corporate and state-driven efforts to partition the Internet into speech-restricting, surveillance-riddled enclaves, we must explore institutional alternatives to protect and cultivate the decentralized Web. A key component will be to bolster projects that empower people to share ownership and control their local Internet infrastructure, such as community broadband and mesh networks. Another, equally important aspect of this work is in creating more platforms—web services and apps—that are to some degree owned and controlled by their community of users, such as platform cooperatives.

          This lightning talk will address how the challenges that the Web faces are questions of economic and institutional concentrations of power. That, in order to counteract the threat of centralization, it's critical that the institutions that comprise the decentralized web are themselves transparent, democratized, and are legally bound to protect the human rights of their users.
