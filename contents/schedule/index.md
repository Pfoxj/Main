      In the last twenty years, we've managed to nearly ruin one of the most functional distributed systems ever created: today's Web. There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code. We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values. Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.
