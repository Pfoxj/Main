In a provocative call to action, entrepreneur and Open Internet advocate, Brewster Kahle, challenges us to build a better, decentralized Web based on new distributed technologies. He lays out a path to creating a new Web that is reliable, private, but still fun—in order to lock the Web open for good."

    description: |
      In the last twenty years, we've managed to nearly ruin one of the most functional distributed systems ever created: today's Web. There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code. We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values. Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.

    description: |
      There are many "Black Hats" on the world stage today.  They have enormous resources, little government oversight, and taps into all the major fiber links.  Their goal: to break the security of your code.  How can the decentralized technologies represented here fend off their attacks?  How would you work around the "Great Firewall of China?"  How are you employing this "Black Hat" understanding into your design?  We'll pose some provocative security scenarios and discuss how decentralized technologies can combat the most powerful purveyors of censorship, surveillance, and piracy on the world stage.  How can builders of a new Web share scenario planning and knowledge to succeed?

          Mediachain is a blockchain-based metadata platform that uses machine learning to turn media into an information transmitter.

          It connects users directly to creators through content, gives creators a permanent voice wherever their images, songs, videos, films, and writings are shared, and allows us to discover everything about what we’re watching, reading, looking at, or listening to, no matter where we find it.

          Imagine being able to connect with the artist of a viral GIF in your feed or being able to automatically reward songwriters whenever you press play. These are just a few examples of what developers can build given the tools to discover and reveal data describing our universal culture.

          We will release the designs for a novel, suitable architecture for a scalable network of blockchains, powered by Tendermint.

          Tendermint is a ""blockchain engine"" that provides provable security for any blockchain.  Tendermint is used by ErisIndustries, tested in the R3 consortium, and is gaining adoption by many other upstarts.

          Blockchain scalability is an active area of research in the cryptocurrency community.  The team behind Tendermint will reveal a novel blockchain network architecture that solves the blockchain scalability problem.

          The lightning talk will quickly explain the problem and proposed architecture, and more discussion/Q&A will happen at the workshop session, hopefully with a big whiteboard.  A link to a whitepaper will be announced prior to the lightning talk, and copies will be available during the workshop.

          The SAFE Network is a p2p storage and communications network which prioritizes data and user security and privacy. The technology is currently in testing phases before launching an Alpha product and this workshop will go over features from a user experience perspective of logging into the network and uploading personal data, creating an entry in the native DNS system, uploading and publishing a website viewable in any browser. Additionally, this session will cover hosting a vault and touch on some of the key aspects of the infrastructure design which supports data security and user anonymity. If there's time/interest, we can also discuss third-party developer opportunities through the API and review some examples.

          Social networking is hugely powerful, but centralized into silos and monocultures. The IndieWeb is a lightweight alternative that lets us do the same things - follow, comment, like, repost, tag people in photos, RSVP to events - between our independent personal web sites, on any CMS or even static site generators. It also interoperates seamlessly with the mainstream social networks.

          I'll give a quick intro, a live demo, and answer questions.

Each Urbit is a part of a global, decentralized network where address space is cryptographic property.  You own your Urbit like bitcoin and control it like your PC.

          We'll take a very quick tour of the Urbit stack and what it's designed to accomplish in a brief talk.  Then, in a workshop, we'll step through some demos: self-hosted publishing and wrangling your existing services with APIs.

This will eliminate the role of centralized ISPs, and lower costs for bandwidth by allowing the network to grow in an organic and decentralized way. Users will load up their devices with cryptocurrency to pay for bandwidth, or install networking equipment on their property to build the network and make some money.

          Prometheus is a peer-to-peer social network for commerce. We ultimately want to build a community where it is possible to help for a living. We aim to provide a fair currency system that embodies this spirit. We call this currency sparks (-1 seconds). This currency is backed by the time of its users voluntarily and exchanged among each other for goods and services. We provide the means for managing the flow of this currency between users automatically through smart contracts. In addition we provide a commodities market that tracks the price of goods in services traded on the network as financial decision making data for negotiating the price of goods and services. This lays the foundation for a sustainable universal basic income that not only encourages contribution to society but the funding of innovation either indirectly through currency or by direct human effort or contribution. The current non-linear, inflationary economies of the world cannot support this concept. This system monetizes charity as opposed to scarcity of resources.  It also meets  the criteria of being an Open Value Network. I'd love to share more information in person. The paper detailing the full system or our github wiki can be reached through our website.
