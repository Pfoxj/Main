20 years after the World Wide Web was created, can we now make it better?  How can we ensure that our most important values: privacy, free speech, and open access to knowledge are enshrined in the code itself?  In a provocative call to action, entrepreneur and Open Internet advocate, Brewster Kahle, challenges us to build a better, decentralized Web based on new distributed technologies.  He lays out a path to creating a new Web that is reliable, private, but still fun—in order to lock the Web open for good."

      "How Stupid Laws and Benevolent Dictators can Ruin the Decentralized Web, too"
      In the last twenty years, we've managed to nearly ruin one of the most functional distributed systems ever created: today's Web.  There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code.  We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values.  Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.
