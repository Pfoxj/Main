  people:
  - name: Christopher Allen
  short_description: At each Rebooting the Web of Trust event we collaboratively create white papers and specifications on topics that will have the greatest impact on the future of self-sovereign identity.
  full_description: "WHAT IS WEB-OF-TRUST<br/><br/>The Web of Trust is a buzzword for a new model of decentralized identity. It\u2019s a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years, the classic definition derives from PGP. But some use it as a term to include identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the concept we aim to reboot it.<br/><br/><br/>PAST EVENTS<br/><br/>All documentation for the event is open source on GitHub<br/><br/>\u2022 2016 Website http://www.weboftrust.info/event-2016-ny and Repository https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop<br/><br/>\u2022\_2015 Website http://www.weboftrust.info/event-2015-sf and Repository https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust<br/><br/>FUTURE GOALS<br/><br/>The goal of each Rebooting the Web of Trust event is to collaboratively generate white papers on topics that will have the greatest impact on the future, and align with the identity needs of the world. <br/><br/>More details on the upcoming September 2016 are coming soon.<br/><br/>The complete documentation of the previous event is available in the github repository, including photos, drafts, and graphic output."

  short_description: To help make connections between decentralized projects and potential civic partners in the form of libraries.
  full_description: One of the challenges with decentralized projects is to find users to scale or stabilize the network. Libraries could provide stable, reliable platforms for decentralized projects that support the overall network and as entry points for community users. <br/><br/>This is brand new, and a new idea for libraries...my goal is to find partners to move the idea forward over the next year.

  short_description: To enable businesses and organisations to capitalise on blockchain technology and benefit from the new opportunities it presents.
  full_description: "Ethcore Ltd. was created to undertake and further exploit the use of blockchain technology for commercial, financial and institutional purposes. Its mission is to enable businesses and organisations to capitalise on blockchain technology and benefit from the new opportunities it presents. It was founded by many of the core technical and operational staff of the Ethereum Foundation, which is the non-profit that created the Ethereum Platform. Ethcore\u2019s team also covers legal, finances and business development expertise.<br/><br/>We're creating the world's fastest and lightest Ethereum client. Written in the sophisticated, cutting-edge Rust language, we can push the limits of reliability, performance and code clarity all at once. Currently available for Ubuntu/Debian, OSX and as a Docker container, Parity can be used to sync with both Homestead and Morden networks, can mine when used with ethminer, can power a Web3 Javascript console when used with eth attach and can be used for Ethereum JSONRPC applications such as a netstats client.<br/><br/>To allow users to get our latest improvements as soon as possible, we aim to make our releases at a roughly 6-week cycle. We maintain three different releases at any one time; the stable release which is our most mature and tested software. The beta release has additional features and better performance but may yet have quirks and issues to be fixed. Finally, the nightly release is our cutting-edge software build but comes with a strong caveat against using it for managing anything of value.

  short_description: Explore monitoring and learning at the edges
  full_description: This is an exploratory prototyping research project focused on decentralizing data collection, analysis, and monitoring. The hypothesis is that a radically decentralized, stream-oriented, functional-programming data architecture deployed at the edges of the Internet can support a wide-variety of high volume/high velocity/high variability (i.e., Big Data) data-centric applications effectively and scalably.<br/><br/>To a large extent, it is a descendant of Croquet -  a decentralized real-time computing platform for scalable shared virtual environments - which was also deployed at the edges of the network, without central servers. Croquet demonstrated that a shared, fully user-programmable 3D virtual world could be effectively implemented in a collective platform composed of the users' computers, connected peer-to-peer. The underlying architecture (TeaTime) was based on replicated data and replicated computing embedded in an extension of the Squeak-Smalltalk computing environment.<br/><br/>While Croquet was designed for focused interaction among people, EdgeD is focused on collecting, persisting, and modeling high velocity data flows, such as might arise in the future from network-connected sensors and actuators. As such, privacy, security, availability, and reliability are important aspects of any future-oriented platform.<br/><br/>The EdgeD project is at an early conceptual stage, and is not yet ready to absorb additional participants.

  short_description: Curating authentic signals in the ever-accelerating noise cloud of information.
  full_description: An emergent service, platform, app, and/or protocol (early R&D phase) for applying the archival and recordkeeping principles of authenticity, reliability, identity, and provenance to the emerging blend of peer-to-peer, AI, IoT, robotics, virtual reality, genome and nano technologies which will make it increasingly difficult to tell truth from lies, human experience from machine reality, to navigate an increasingly blurry line between fact and fantasy, and to preserve a trustworthy collective memory as our transhumanist selves hurdle into the singularity.

  short_description: Blockchain technology stack focused on pluggable consensus mechanisms, smart contract vms, and security models
  full_description: The Hyperledger Project is an open source collaborative project hosted by the Linux Foundation.  Its goal is to foster the development of a blockchain platform that could be useful to a wide variety of use cases and related projects, by allowing certain parameters (choice of consensus mechanism, choice of language for smart contracts, security model, perhaps more) to be configurable modules to a common framework.  We are starting with a codebase built for permissioned-chain needs, but we have a strong desire to work with other blockchain efforts to share code.

  short_description: We are bringing an open, collaborative annotation layer to the Web and all the knowledge therein.
  full_description: "Hypothesis brings universal (all content, all formats, all browsers and many native applications), in-place annotation to anything accessible on the web. We envision and enable an interoperable, shared layer over all knowledge where users can tag, comment on, and discuss documents, in public or in private, individually or in teams. We have built a standard toolset that stores annotations in the cloud, under users\u2019 control, and displays them as an overlay on content wherever it resides \u2013 in the open or behind paywalls. This interoperable layer enables both conversational and computational annotation, powerfully augmenting workflows in scholarly discourse, investigative journalism, the classroom, and many other areas.<br/><br/>Everything we build is guided by our principles. In particular that it be free, open, non-profit, neutral and lasting to name a few.<br/><br/>We are a non-profit organization, funded through the generosity of the Knight, Mellon, Shuttleworth, Sloan and Helmsley Foundations\u2013 and through the support of hundreds of individuals like yourself that want to see this idea come to fruition.  We create software, push for standards, and foster community.<br/><br/>Our efforts are based on the Annotator project, which we are principal contributors to, and annotation standards for digital documents being developed by the W3C Web Annotation Working Group. We are partnering broadly with developers, publishers, academic institutions, researchers, and individuals to bring this new capability to bear on diverse use cases."

  short_description: A database for the decentralized stack (or world computer).
  full_description: "\"Overview:<br/>IPDB is a global database for everyone, everywhere. It is built with identity and creators in mind. It allows the management of personal data, reputation, and privacy, along with secure attribution, metadata, licensing, and links to media files. It\u2019s also flexible: the ultimate applications are up to users' imaginations, for everything from equal-opportunity banking to energy innovation. It is decentralized, so that no one owns or controls the infrastructure. IPDB will provide a queryable database for the decentralized stack, along with IPFS and Swarm for data storage and Ethereum for processing.<br/><br/>Caretakers:<br/>Caretakers are at the heart of IPDB. Caretakers are responsible for operating the validating nodes that make up the network, and for governance.<br/><br/>These organizations have volunteered to be founding caretakers: ascribe/BigchainDB, Blockstack, COALA, Consensys, Dyne.org, Eris Industries, Internet Archive, IPFS, OpenMedia, SmartContract, Synereo, Tendermint, and UnMonastery.<br/><br/>Governance:<br/>IPDB Foundation is a not-for-profit association registered in Germany. The IPDB articles of incorporation will be available on the IPDB Foundation website.<br/><br/>The members of the association are also the caretakers who operate the validating nodes. They will elect a board of directors responsible for the day-to-day operation of the IPDB Foundation. The caretakers will also vote to add or remove caretakers, or to change the rules of the association.<br/><br/>Long-term the Foundation will become a fully decentralized autonomous organization: code run by participating entities without a defined membership or formal legal personality.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>IPDB is a federated network, where data is spread across a number of nodes. A transaction is accepted if the majority of nodes confirm it as valid. The initial version of IPDB is based on BigchainDB (bigchaindb.com/whitepaper).<br/><br/>Roadmap:<br/>IPDB rollout follows six main steps; the first three are for the test net, and the next three for the production net.<br/><br/>1. Test net (reset data periodically, not guaranteed stable)<br/>1.1 For demo applications [now]<br/>1.2 For invited users [soon]<br/>1.3 For general public<br/><br/>2. Production net (data stable)<br/>2.1 For demo applications<br/>2.2 For invited users<br/>2.3 For general public<br/><br/>IPDB technology will move from server-based to server-less decentralization when appropriate scalable technology and resources for integration are ready.\""

  short_description: a next-generation hypermedia protocol to make the Web faster, safer, decentralized, and permanent.
  full_description: 'IPFS -- the InterPlanetary File System -- is a next-generation web transport protocol to make the Web faster, safer, decentralized, and permanent. It is based on git, bittorrent, and other p2p systems. Content-addressed and signed hyperlinks allow web content and apps to be distributed peer-to-peer, to work without an origin server, to be encrypted end-to-end, to be censorship resistant, to work while offline, and more.<br/><br/>IPFS has been hailed by many web developers and network researchers as "the future of the web", as "the next breakthrough protocol", and as "the most exciting project since bitcoin". Though in alpha, hundreds of developers already use IPFS to distribute Billions of files, to make distributed webapps, to archive large datasets, to make dynamic realtime apps, and more. IPFS has a large (400+) open source development community.<br/><br/>These are some of the things IPFS already can do or will do in the future:<br/>- Decentralized and distributed apps and webapps (no origin server, work in local area networks, do not need infrastructure beyond the brower, etc).<br/>- Secure, authenticated transfers (think wget + git + pgp)<br/>- Vastly improved network utilization and download speeds<br/>- Apps and Webapps that can continue to work in internet-remote environments, through uplink outages, through natural disasters, connectivity disruption, etc.<br/>- Give permanence to digital objects (think DOI but cryptographically secure and without a central authority)<br/>- Bandwidth sharing for data distribution -- including for web content<br/>- Decentralized naming, with no authority (cryptographic names)<br/>- Self-archiving web -- Apps, Webapps, and Data that can outlast its creators<br/>- Anti-censorship web -- content is not centrally named and can be re-distributed by anyone.<br/><br/>Representing at the Summit: <br/>- Juan Benet<br/>- David Dias<br/>- Jeromy Johnson<br/><br/>Notable others:<br/>- Samuli Poyhtari<br/>- Lars Gierth<br/>- Fridel Ziegelmayer<br/>- Nicola Greco<br/>- Mildred Ki''La<br/>- Richard Littauer<br/>- David A Roberts<br/>- Matt Bell<br/>- Christian Couder<br/><br/>And 400+ other contributors.'

  short_description: "a people-focused alternative to the \u2018corporate web\u2019."
  full_description: "Your content is yours<br/>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users\u2019 data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.<br/><br/>You are better connected<br/>Your articles and status messages can go to all services, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they\u2019re all in one place.<br/><br/>You are in control<br/>You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as example.com/ideas. These links are permanent and will always work.<br/><br/>Key principles of building on the indie web, numbered for reference, not necessarily for any kind of priority.<br/>\u270A Own your data.<br/>\uD83D\uDD0D Use visible data for humans first, machines second. See also DRY.<br/>\uD83D\uDCAA Build tools for yourself, not for all of your friends. It's extremely hard to fight Metcalfe's law: you won't be able to convince all your friends to join the independent web. But if you build something that satisfies your own needs, but is backwards compatible for people who haven't joined in (say, by practicing POSSE), the time and effort you've spent building your own tools isn't wasted just because others haven't joined in yet.<br/>\uD83D\uDE0B Eat your own dogfood. Whatever you build should be for yourself. If you aren't depending on it, why should anybody else? We call that selfdogfooding. More importantly, build the indieweb around your needs. If you design tools for some hypothetical user, they may not actually exist; if you build tools for yourself, you actually do exist. selfdogfooding is also a form of \"proof of work\" to help focus on productive interactions.<br/>\uD83D\uDCD3 Document your stuff. You've built a place to speak your mind, use it to document your processes, ideas, designs and code. At least document it for your future self.<br/>\uD83D\uDC9E Open source your stuff! You don't have to, of course, but if you like the existence of the indie web, making your code open source means other people can get on the indie web quicker and easier.<br/>\uD83D\uDCD0 UX and design is more important than protocols, formats, data models, schema etc. We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we build/develop/subset the absolutely simplest, easiest, and most minimal protocols & formats sufficient to support that UX, and nothing more. AKA UX before plumbing.<br/>\uD83C\uDF10 Build platform agnostic platforms. The more your code is modular and composed of pieces you can swap out, the less dependent you are on a particular device, UI, templating language, API, backend language, storage model, database, platform. The more your code is modular, the greater the chance that at least some of it can and will be re-used, improved, which you can then reincorporate.<br/>\uD83D\uDDFF Longevity. Build for the long web. If human society is able to preserve ancient papyrus, Victorian photographs and dinosaur bones, we should be able to build web technology that doesn't require us to destroy everything we've done every few years in the name of progress.<br/>\u2728 Plurality. With IndieWebCamp we've specifically chosen to encourage and embrace a diversity of approaches & implementations. This background makes the IndieWeb stronger and more resilient than any one (often monoculture) approach.<br/>\uD83C\uDF89 Have fun. Remember that GeoCities page you built back in the mid-90s? The one with the Java applets, garish green background and seventeen animated GIFs? It may have been ugly, badly coded and sucky, but it was fun, damnit. Keep the web weird and interesting.<br/><br/>Amber Case, Kevin Marks, Amy Guy, Dan Gillmor"

  short_description: To overcome the challanges induced by proprietary and centralized internet services by empowering users to be in full control over their data using free and open communication standards that promote decentralization.
  full_description: 'Today''s internet is dominated by proprietary and centralized services run by private corporations. Many of these companies generate their revenue with the data they receive from users: data is uploaded/stored by the client (the user) to the "cloud" (the service provider). The resulting ecosystem implies several challenging problems:                                                                                                                                               <br/>1) When a user uploads data she usually gives up control over it (loss of true ownership).                                                         <br/>2) The user may then not be able to export/transfer her data to another service provider (vendor locking).                                         <br/>3) The user could loose her data altogether should the provider stop it''s service (single point of failure).                                       <br/>4) When a user signs up for another service she may have to enter the same information repeatedly (data duplication).                              <br/>5) The service provider has to manage more and more user data with changing legal/privacy requirements (cost of data management).                           <br/>6) User data stored at the service provider is bound to become out of date (cost of data quality).                                                         <br/>7) Service providers that have grown into quasi monopolies tend to inhibit market competition and product diversity (market failure).              <br/>8) Service provider monopolies are at risk to use their power in ways that are harmful to individuals or society as a whole e.g. through activities of censorship, data manipulation or surveillance (risk of power abuse).                                                                                <br/><br/>The relevance of these issues is expected to rise when we enter the era of Internet of Things where billions of smart sensors start to collect more and more privacy invasive data sets.<br/><br/>Knowing this and considering our ethical and technical concerns we are convinced that the solution can only mean that users must first and foremost be empowered to be in full control of their own data.<br/>Can this goal be achieved while still being compatible with the existing world and/or even beneficial to data processing service providers? <br/><br/>We believe so and think to have found a promising solution in Social Linked Data (Solid). In simple terms, Solid maps data in the web to a graph where the graph nodes represent resources (e.g. an image, a user profile) and  the connecting vertices the relationship between them (e.g. "image <belongs to> user profile"). Users can create nodes and links between them. As a node owner the user can define permissions (i.e. who can read/write/delete the node). As each node could be deployed to it''s own server the graph features attributes of a decentralized network. Service providers (or anyone else) can build applications that operate on top of the graph requesting permissions to read nodes while respecting data owners sovereignty.   <br/><br/>The Jolocom project is currently implementing a Solid application as a proof of concept. The current focus is to provide its users with seamless "graph" interaction and to explore how it can be connected to the the existing world. Advanced features such as identity management and distributed search are work in progress. Other decentralized technologies that can enhance the graph are under evaluation (e.g. IPFS for node replication, Blockstack for decentralized DNS, blockchain for managing identities.)

  short_description: Mediachain is a universal media library that utilizes content ID technology.
  full_description: "Every day billions of images, songs, videos, and written works are shared online, but they quickly lose connection to their creator or any information about them as they are reposted. What if all data about media was completely open and decentralized, and developers could utilize the technology behind Shazam or Google Image Search to easily retrieve it? We\u2019d know who made what, its history, or even how to pay the creator, in a completely decentralized, programmable way.<br/><br/>Mediachain combines a decentralized media library with open content identification technology to enable collaboratively registering, identifying, and tracking creative works online. In turn, developers can automate attribution, preserve history, provide creators and organizations with rich analytics about how their content is being used, and even create a channel for exchanging value directly through content, no matter where it is.<br/><br/>Imagine being able to connect with the artist of a viral GIF in your feed or being able to automatically reward musicians whenever you press play.<br/><br/>Mediachain is an open source project, started in January 2016. Unlike other media libraries, Mediachain employs a decentralized architecture built on top of IPFS, meaning there is no central point of control and the network is open to anyone wishing to participate. This makes it an ideal environment for collaboration and innovation among media organizations, distribution platforms, and independent creators and developers who want to retain control over their data while broadening their reach."

  short_description: Decentralized naming system based on Bitcoin algorithms, code, and threat model
  full_description: 'Namecoin is the first naming system that is simultaneously global (everyone gets the same result for the same lookup), decentralized (no central party decides which names map to which values), and human-meaningful (names aren''t just a hash or something similarly opaque to humans).  Previous naming systems such as the standard DNS system, .onion, and .i2p are unable to simultaneously achieve all 3 of these properties.<br/><br/>Namecoin achieves this by recognizing that Bitcoin''s achievement of a decentralized consensus (via a Nakamoto blockchain) has applications outside of the financial system, including naming.  Namecoin was the first fork of Bitcoin (we forked Bitcoin before it was cool), and extends Bitcoin''s blockchain validation rules to allow coins to represent human-readable names with arbitrary values attached.  The Namecoin blockchain validation rules enforce that all transactions in the blockchain honor uniqueness of names, and that only the owner of a name can update its value.  Namecoin''s threat model is very similar to that of Bitcoin: like Bitcoin, Namecoin is mined via SHA256D proof-of-work, and inclusion in the blockchain of a transaction (even if checked via a lightweight client) implies that miners have verified the transaction''s correctness.<br/><br/>Namecoin''s current and proposed use cases include DNS, replacing HTTPS certificate authorities, providing DNS for non-IP protocols such as Tor hidden services, I2P, and Freenet, public key verification for protocols such as PGP and OTR, and single sign-on for website users.<br/><br/>Namecoin has an international development team, and is always looking for new contributors.  We''d also love to collaborate with your project.'

  short_description: Security and privacy focused decentralized storage and communications platform
  full_description: The SAFE Network is a decentralized network with user privacy and data security as its core. A decade of research and development has culminated into a platform which securely and anonymously distributes data globally while providing a sustainable economic system for the resources contributed by the users. Third party developers have opportunity to build applications which retain these security and privacy features by default on top of a network that is commonly owned by the global community of users. <br/><br/>Several innovations power this platform including third-party-less authentication, sharable client side encryption of data, obfuscated global routing, consensus-based data reliability and an economic system for user and developer incentives. While the release candidate will see a network facilitating decentralized storage, communication and asset transfer, a future goal will implement computation allowing for a truly decentralized alternative to the exiting Internet. <br/><br/>The current testing period allows for users to experience basic interfaces and even upload a website viewable in most browsers while developers can work with the exposed API to start integrating existing or building new applications which replace central storage needs in servers. The focus on inherent security allows developers to alleviate liability of user data and the users themselves to be safe from censorship or surveillance.

  short_description: Development Framework for building Decentralized Real-time Collaborative Apps
  full_description: 'Building decentralized software is hard. Development frameworks are built thinking in centralized apps, moreover when thinking of collaborative apps. SwellRT is a development framework for building decentralized real-time collaborative apps, very easily and avoiding extra code to the developer. SwellRT provides a server side (storage, sharing, identity, federation) and an API to build apps in JavaScript, Java or Android. Think of Google Drive RT API or Firebase but decentralized & open source.<br/><br/>We know decentralized apps/services can alleviate some of the current challenges of the Internet, such as centralization of data/power, or privacy issues. However, building truly decentralized apps/services is still a complex task. Developers spend plenty of effort integrating technologies and protocols, which involves that less resources can be committed to build actual features which provide value for final users.<br/><br/>SwellRT is a free/open source framework for developers which changes that: SwellRT makes it easy to build decentralized apps.<br/><br/>Its main principle is to hide all technical complexity of decentralization, allowing developers to keep focus on valuable service features. This is achieved thanks to:<br/>- Out-of-the-box integrated Open Source solutions and standards for communication (WebSockets), concurrency control (Wave Protocol), storage, identity and federation (Matrix.org)<br/>- Provide an easy and plain (but powerful) decentralized programming model, not requiring special training for developers.<br/>- Give an API extremely easy to use in current platforms and apps, taking advantage of latests perks of programming languages such as JavaScript Proxies.<br/><br/>Examples? You may build decentralized versions of Google Docs, Etherpad, Trello or Slack... or new tools for collaborative drawing or collaborative mapping.<br/><br/>*How does it work?*<br/>SwellRT is a client-server system where servers form a federated network. Each server handles a set of data and users in the network. SwellRT is not a classic database as long as it provides higher level services than those.<br/><br/>Data is organized in entities called Collaborative Objects. They are just self contained tree-like structures - a sort of JSON documents with metadata - that can be created on behalf of apps and users. Collaborative objects can be shared and used *in real time* from any client connected to any server according to different access control policies.<br/><br/>The simple API allows to login the network and to access objects as if they were native language objects, receiving/sending changes back & forth in real time.

  short_description: distributed encrypted storage
  full_description: 'Tahoe-LAFS (https://tahoe-lafs.org) is a system to store files and directories across multiple untrusted servers. Data is redundantly<br/>erasure-coded to be available even if some servers fail, and is encrypted to prevent server operators from learning or modifying your files.<br/><br/>Tahoe was first created for an online personal-backup company (AllMyData, now defunct). The 1.0 open-source release was in 2008, and the latest (1.11.0)<br/>was in March 2016. Development is fairly active.<br/><br/>Tahoe-LAFS has an apparently-unique capability-based access control mechanism with no central administrators, identities, or ACLs. Each uploaded file gets<br/>a cryptographic "filecap" string, which is both necessary and sufficient to download the file. Servers do not learn filecaps. The system provides (im)mutable files and directories. The directed graph of file objects enables easy sharing topologies (although the approach feels foreign to many people).<br/><br/>Tahoe is written in Python, and has a basic HTTP API, a web-based directory browser, CLI tools, and FTP/SFTP frontends. Several backup tools have added support for Tahoe-LAFS as a backend.<br/><br/>Tahoe users join a "grid", which is a particular set of clients and storage servers that connect to and hold data for each other. Each grid uses a central "Introducer" to distribute connectivity information.<br/><br/>We have several deployment styles in mind:<br/><br/>* "personal grid": e.g. my laptop, desktop, and a rented VPS server. This is a personal backup solution: if my laptop breaks, I recover from the desktop, and if the house burns down, I recover both (slowly) from the VPS.<br/><br/>* "friendnet": a group of people configure their boxes as client+server, and store data on each other. This is a group backup solution, and is handy for sharing files among group members too.<br/><br/>* "commercial net": an individual pays a company to run a storage server for them. Paid backup solution.<br/><br/>We''d love to run the "one true grid" (unbounded size, where all users of Tahoe would join the same grid), and it would be easier to explain. But we don''t know how to make that work. Scaling connections and repair work is one problem, but tragedy-of-the-commons is the larger one. I currently expect most grids to include at most a few hundred machines.<br/><br/>Our philosophy is that you are probably more than capable of providing your own resources, but if you want to pay someone for service, that should be easy. And running a server should be almost as easy as running a client.'

  short_description: Torrents in your web browser
  full_description: "What is WebTorrent?<br/><br/>WebTorrent is the first torrent client that works in the browser. YEP, THAT'S RIGHT. THE BROWSER.<br/><br/>It's written completely in JavaScript \u2013 the language of the web \u2013 and uses WebRTC for true peer-to-peer transport. No browser plugin, extension, or installation is required.<br/><br/>Using open web standards, WebTorrent connects website users together to form a distributed, decentralized browser-to-browser network for efficient file transfer.<br/><br/>Why is this cool?<br/><br/>Imagine a video site like YouTube, where visitors help to host the site's content. The more people that use a WebTorrent-powered website, the faster and more resilient it becomes.<br/><br/>Browser-to-browser communication cuts out the middle-man and lets people communicate on their own terms. No more client/server \u2013 just a network of peers, all equal. WebTorrent is the first step in the journey to redecentralize the Web."

  short_description: censorship-resistant money, smart contracts, and shared database
  full_description: Zcash is a cryptocurrency with selective transparency. Transactions that are posted to the blockchain are encrypted, and the creator of the transaction can disclose the decryption keys to selected parties so that they can see the contents of the transaction.<br/><br/>Everyone else can see only an encrypted transaction that reveals nothing about the sender, recipient, value transferred, or the attached metadata. Therefore everyone else (who hasn't been provided with the decryption key) cannot link transactions with one another (for example, can't tell if two transactions were performed by the same party or different parties).<br/><br/>Zero-knowledge proofs are used to prevent cheating -- each encrypted transaction comes with a zero-knowledge proof that the transaction doesn't create money out of thin air nor double-spend money.<br/><br/>This design has the following consequences:<br/><br/>* Censorship-resistant digital cash. Anyone can pay anyone else, without requiring permission and without fear of their transactions being spied on.<br/><br/>* Fungibility. Because the flow of money is not (usually) traceable very far back into history, you can rely on your Zcash to be worth face value -- worth as much as any other Zcash -- when you try to use it.<br/><br/>* Selective transparency. The blockchain is a shared database, a "single source of truth" that all users have consensus about. And the contents of the blockchain can be selectively revealed to chosen parties instead of being globally readable.
