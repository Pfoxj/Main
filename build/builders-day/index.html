The Internet Archive, which he founded in 1996, now preserves 25 petabytes of data—the books, Web pages, music, television, and software of our cultural heritage, working with more than 450 library and university partners to create a digital library, accessible to all.</div>

          <div>At a young age Jeremy was sidetracked from his ultimate goal of protecting digital civil liberties by the allure of building and programming robots, which was the focus of his work in college and grad school.  Having worked on drones and autonomous cars he is aware of their potential benefits for society, but is also that much more prepared to guard against the dangers they present to privacy and civil liberties. Of course, having worked at EFF for nearly a year Jeremy has covered a wide variety of tech topics, including mobile devices, big data, and net neutrality, just to name a few. A strong believer in never taking the straightforward path to anything, Jeremy went to Caltech for undergrad, then got his PhD in computer science from Stanford University by working on robotics projects with a professor in electrical engineering from UC Berkeley.
