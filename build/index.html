        <p>The current Web is not private or censorship-free. It lacks a memory, a way to preserve our culture’s digital record through time. The Decentralized Web aims to make the Web open, secure and free of censorship by distributing data, processing, and hosting across millions of computers around the world, with no centralized control.</p>

        <p>The Summit &amp; meetup is a two-day event for high level discussions among leaders from around the globe working on decentralized technologies. What decentralized applications are being built today, and what is just around the corner? Together, can we prototype the Decentralized Web and start to lock the Web open for good?</p>

                <div>Paige is an advocate for open standards, user privacy and decentralized technologies. She received a BFA practicing experimental art with a strong focus on complexity in nature through interactive installations. Her understanding of natural decentralized systems would map rather eloquently to her growing interest in censorship resistant technologies as she started working for mesh networking startup Open Garden and organizing many bitcoin and cryptocurrency events in San Francisco. In early 2014, Paige met Scotland-based company, MaidSafe who are building a peer-to-peer Internet stemming from similar principles within natural systems which were so attractive to her many years prior and she has been working on various communication efforts full-time with MaidSafe since.
