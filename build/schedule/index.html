      <div class="description">20 years after the World Wide Web was created, can we now make it better?  How can we ensure that our most important values: privacy, free speech, and open access to knowledge are enshrined in the code itself?  In a provocative call to action, entrepreneur and Open Internet advocate, Brewster Kahle, challenges us to build a better, decentralized Web based on new distributed technologies. He lays out a path to creating a new Web that is reliable, private, but still fun—in order to lock the Web open for good.</div>

      <div class="description">In the last twenty years, we've managed to nearly ruin one of the most functional distributed systems ever created: today's Web. There are many stakeholders being damaged in the process, from individuals to entire nations.  To lock open the Web we will need more than code. We will need binding agreements and covenants that enshrine our deepest values. Cory Doctorow shares his vision of what went wrong and how we can get it right – through governance and policies – in the decentralized Web to come.

Their goal: to break the security of your code.  How can the decentralized technologies represented here fend off their attacks?  How would you work around the "Great Firewall of China?"  How are you employing this "Black Hat" understanding into your design?  We'll pose some provocative security scenarios and discuss how decentralized technologies can combat the most powerful purveyors of censorship, surveillance, and piracy on the world stage.  How can builders of a new Web share scenario planning and knowledge to succeed?

    On June 9th, the day after the Decentralized Web Summit, we will be hosting a Decentralized Web meetup at the Internet Archive. This meetup is free and open to the public. We will have tables set up for people to meet and hack on decentralized web projects, and have lightning talks scheduled in the Great Room upstairs throughout the day. If you are interested in learning more about the decentralized web or working on related projects with your peers, this is the place to be! Snacks and drinks will be provided.

It connects users directly to creators through content, gives creators a permanent voice wherever their images, songs, videos, films, and writings are shared, and allows us to discover everything about what we’re watching, reading, looking at, or listening to, no matter where we find it.

Imagine being able to connect with the artist of a viral GIF in your feed or being able to automatically reward songwriters whenever you press play. These are just a few examples of what developers can build given the tools to discover and reveal data describing our universal culture.

Tendermint is a ""blockchain engine"" that provides provable security for any blockchain.  Tendermint is used by ErisIndustries, tested in the R3 consortium, and is gaining adoption by many other upstarts.

Blockchain scalability is an active area of research in the cryptocurrency community.  The team behind Tendermint will reveal a novel blockchain network architecture that solves the blockchain scalability problem.

The lightning talk will quickly explain the problem and proposed architecture, and more discussion/Q&A will happen at the workshop session, hopefully with a big whiteboard.  A link to a whitepaper will be announced prior to the lightning talk, and copies will be available during the workshop.

See you there!

          <div>Jae Kwon is a blockchain software architect and cofounder of Tendermint. After graduating from Cornell in 2005 with a B.S. degree in computer science, he worked as a professional developer in Silicon Valley, including at Alexa, and at Yelp where he led the mobile application development team. He also cofounded iDoneThis, a productivity service. Jae has worked on numerous open-source projects, including a CoffeeScript compiler/interpreter written in Javascript, an end-to-end encrypted email system called Scramble.io, and a cryptocurrency exchange.  These projects were inspired by the cryptopunk hacker ethos, which ultimately led to the current work with Tendermint. Jae has been working on a project he created in 2014, called Tendermint. He invented and refined the Tendermint consensus algorithm with the aim of liberating the blockchain from the costs and drawbacks of proof-of-work mining.  His mission is to make this technology more accessible, in order to accelerate the adoption of decentralized ledger technology.

Additionally, this session will cover hosting a vault and touch on some of the key aspects of the infrastructure design which supports data security and user anonymity. If there's time/interest, we can also discuss third-party developer opportunities through the API and review some examples.

Each Urbit is a part of a global, decentralized network where address space is cryptographic property.  You own your Urbit like bitcoin and control it like your PC.

We'll take a very quick tour of the Urbit stack and what it's designed to accomplish in a brief talk.  Then, in a workshop, we'll step through some demos: self-hosted publishing and wrangling your existing services with APIs.

Tendermint is a ""blockchain engine"" that provides provable security for any blockchain.  Tendermint is used by ErisIndustries, tested in the R3 consortium, and is gaining adoption by many other upstarts.

Blockchain scalability is an active area of research in the cryptocurrency community.  The team behind Tendermint will reveal a novel blockchain network architecture that solves the blockchain scalability problem.

The lightning talk will quickly explain the problem and proposed architecture, and more discussion/Q&A will happen at the workshop session, hopefully with a big whiteboard.  A link to a whitepaper will be announced prior to the lightning talk, and copies will be available during the workshop.

See you there!

          <div>Jae Kwon is a blockchain software architect and cofounder of Tendermint. After graduating from Cornell in 2005 with a B.S. degree in computer science, he worked as a professional developer in Silicon Valley, including at Alexa, and at Yelp where he led the mobile application development team. He also cofounded iDoneThis, a productivity service. Jae has worked on numerous open-source projects, including a CoffeeScript compiler/interpreter written in Javascript, an end-to-end encrypted email system called Scramble.io, and a cryptocurrency exchange.  These projects were inspired by the cryptopunk hacker ethos, which ultimately led to the current work with Tendermint. Jae has been working on a project he created in 2014, called Tendermint. He invented and refined the Tendermint consensus algorithm with the aim of liberating the blockchain from the costs and drawbacks of proof-of-work mining.  His mission is to make this technology more accessible, in order to accelerate the adoption of decentralized ledger technology.

We aim to provide a fair currency system that embodies this spirit. We call this currency sparks (-1 seconds). This currency is backed by the time of its users voluntarily and exchanged among each other for goods and services. We provide the means for managing the flow of this currency between users automatically through smart contracts. In addition we provide a commodities market that tracks the price of goods in services traded on the network as financial decision making data for negotiating the price of goods and services. This lays the foundation for a sustainable universal basic income that not only encourages contribution to society but the funding of innovation either indirectly through currency or by direct human effort or contribution. The current non-linear, inflationary economies of the world cannot support this concept. This system monetizes charity as opposed to scarcity of resources.  It also meets  the criteria of being an Open Value Network. I'd love to share more information in person. The paper detailing the full system or our github wiki can be reached through our website.

Each Urbit is a part of a global, decentralized network where address space is cryptographic property.  You own your Urbit like bitcoin and control it like your PC.

We'll take a very quick tour of the Urbit stack and what it's designed to accomplish in a brief talk.  Then, in a workshop, we'll step through some demos: self-hosted publishing and wrangling your existing services with APIs.

          <div>Greg currently works on search for the Wayback Machine, but caught the distributed computing bug while working on the Legion metacomputing system in the late 1990s. Formerly, he was founder/CTO of a web-scale search engine, which was sold to IBM Watson in 2015. Before that, he was founder/Distinguished Engineer at a supercomputing startup. For fun, he plays a bunch of Renaissance-era musical instruments, and taught himself Italian so that he could reconstruct the dances in 16th century Italian dance manuals.
